      <p>Thanks for visiting my page and for considering my application. ðŸ˜Š</p>

        <p>I'm someone who likes to ask the <span class="underline">BIG</span> questions in life: What does it mean to live a good life? How does one find meaning in life? And of course, why am I here? These
          questions led me to pursuing a Masters Degree in Applied Ethics, and are now (hopefully), leading me onto this new path of learning to write code with Founders and Coders...</p>

        <p>I enjoy reading, mountaineering, travelling and experiencing other cultures, doing yoga, practicing meditation, exercising and keeping fit; researching health, diet and the natural sciences, going to art galleries, learning new languages (oral and programming),
          and being
          out in nature. I've visited roughly 30 countries; spent a year living in Taiwan teaching English, where I failed spectacularly at speaking Chinese - though, I do still have the essentials covered (to ask where to buy ice cream), as well
          a year studying in Sweden speaking slightly better Svenska: 'Jaha! Jag Ã¤r Michael frÃ¥n England.'</p>

        <h2>Why coding?</h2>
        <p>I built my first primitive website on the 'old' internet when I was much younger. When asked once what I wanted to do as an adult, I remember replying <i>'work with computers'</i>. Now, I am working with computers, but not quite in the way
          I expected back then. Hopefully, little by little, I'm starting to put that right.</p>

        <p>After spending the last few months slowly(!) learning how to code, it seems safe to say that I now feel I'm at the point of no return. I've found it, at times, to be quite challenging. Learning Javascript, in particular, has been more
          difficult than learning Spanish was for me, personally. I do, however, love a challenge. Moreover, as someone interested in
          philosophy, I feel coding is great for engaging me in the kind of reasoning that philosophy, particularly moral philosophy, often does: how to find answers to problems using logic and reasoning. Now
          that I am
          officially
          hooked, I feel I will always wonder 'what if?' if I don't pursue coding to its' logical conclusion!</p>

      <h2>Why Founders and Coders?</h2>
      <p>This time last year, I had never even heard of Founders and Coders. Nevertheless, I'd decided that I wanted to get into coding, but didn't have the time or the resources available. I am already thankful to Founders and Coders for
        offering a friendly, inviting place to learn how to code. I've met some exceptionally friendly, helpful, and interesting people during the meetups,
        and
        have had nothing but positive experiences thus far. <br><br>Additionally, as someone who values altruism and acts of kindness, and as someone that currently works in the charity sector themselves, the ethos of helping others once you have
        honed
        your craft massively appeals to me. Similarly, having a background in teaching further makes me excited about the prospect of mentoring fellow learners.</p>
