        <p>I'm someone who likes to ask the BIG questions in life: What does it mean to live a good life? How does one find meaning in life? And of course, why am I here? These
          questions led me to pursuing a Masters Degree in Applied Ethics.
        <p>I enjoy reading, mountaineering, travelling and experiencing other cultures, playing guitar, doing yoga, practicing meditation, exercising and keeping fit; researching and studying the natural sciences, going to art galleries, learning new languages (oral and programming),
          and being out in nature.</p>
          <p>I've visited roughly 30 countries and spent a year living in Taiwan teaching English, where I failed spectacularly at speaking Chinese - though I do still have the essentials covered (I can ask with phonetic and tonal precision where to buy ice cream). It was here I developed a serious interest in Zen meditation after attending weekly classes, and I've since been meditating daily for the past four years. Learning to meditate has helped me develop better calmness, equanimity, concentration, and, above all, compassion. I also spent a year studying in Sweden; speaking slightly better Svenska than my Chinese: 'Jaha! Jag √§r Michael fr√•n England.'</p>

        <h2>Building this site</h2>
        <p>I love learning, so I decided to spend the lockdown productively by learning more about HTML, CSS, and some basic JavaScript. I chose GitHub as my host as I figured it would be useful for me to understand and develop some basic principles of Git and GitHub; both for my personal and professional life.
</p>
<p>

I built the image carousel using just basic vanilla JavaScript, in conjunction with HTML and CSS.  Building the carousel proved to be quite challenging (and time-consuming!), but I found the experience to be rewarding and useful.
</p>
<p>Moreover, as someone who's interested in philosophy, dealing with code turned out to be perfect for engaging me in the kind of reasoning that philosophy ‚Äì particularly moral philosophy ‚Äì often does: problem-solving using logic and reason. I felt as though building this site would help me put some of this reasoning, as well as my creativity, to the test üòè
