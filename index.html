      <p>Thanks for visiting my page and for considering my application. ðŸ˜Š</p>

        <p>I'm someone who likes to ask the <span class="underline">BIG</span> questions in life: What does it mean to live a good life? How does one find meaning in life? And of course, why am I here? These
          questions led me to pursuing a Masters Degree in Applied Ethics, and are now (hopefully), leading me onto this new path of learning to write code with Founders and Coders...</p>

        <p>I enjoy reading, mountaineering, travelling and experiencing other cultures, doing yoga, practicing meditation, exercising and keeping fit; researching health, diet and the natural sciences, going to art galleries, learning new languages (oral and programming),
          and being
          out in nature.</p>
          <p>I've visited roughly 30 countries and spent a year living in Taiwan teaching English, where I failed spectacularly at speaking Chinese - though I do still have the essentials covered (I can ask with phonetic and tonal precision where to buy ice cream). It was here I developed a serious interest in Zen meditation after attending weekly classes, and have been meditating daily for the past four years. Learning to meditate has helped me develop better calmness, equanimity, concentration and, above all, compassion. I also spent
          a year studying in Sweden; speaking slightly better Svenska than my Chinese: 'Jaha! Jag Ã¤r Michael frÃ¥n England.'</p>

        <h2>Building this site</h2>
        <p>After spending the last few months slowly(!) learning how to code, it seems safe to say that I now feel I'm at the point of no return. I've found it, at times, to be quite challenging. Learning JavaScript, in particular, has been more
          difficult for me, personally, than learning Spanish was. I do, however, love a challenge. Moreover, as someone interested in
          philosophy, I feel coding is perfect for engaging me in the kind of reasoning that philosophy â€“ particularly moral philosophy â€“ often does: how to find answers to problems using logic and reason. I felt as though buiding this site would help me put some of this reasoning to use!
