      <h2>About Me.</h2>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="meditating" src="images/Meditate.png" alt="meditating-img">
        <p>I have a Bachelors Degree in Audio Production and currently work in academic publishing for the <a href="https://microbiologysociety.org/">Microbiology Society</a>, a science-based charity.
          <p>I'm someone who likes to ask the <span class="underline">BIG</span> questions in life: What does it mean to live a good life? Who am I really? And of course, Why am I here? These
            questions have led me to pursuing a Masters Degree in Applied Ethics, and are now (hopefully), leading me onto this new path of learning to write code with Founders and Coders!</p>

          <p>I enjoy reading, hiking (mountaineering in general), doing yoga, practicing meditation, exercising and keeping fit, travelling, researching health and diet, the natural sciences, going to art galleries, learning new languages, and being
            out in nature.</p>

            <h3>Why coding?</h3>
            <p>After spending the last few months slowly(!) learning how to code, it seems safe to say that I now feel I'm at the point of no return. I've found it, at times, to be quite challenging. Learning Javascript in particular, has been more
              difficult than learning Spanish. I do, however, love a challenge. Moreover, as I mentioned earlier, as someone interested in
              philosophy and asking the "bigger" questions in life, I feel coding is great for engaging me in the kind of reasoning that philosophy, particularly moral philosophy, often does: how to find answers to problems using logic and reasoning.
              Now
              that I am
              officially
              hooked, I feel I will always wonder 'what if?' if I don't pursue coding to its' logical conclusion!</p>

        <h2>Why Founders and Coders?</h2>
        <p>This time last year, I had never so much as even heard of Founders and Coders. Nevertheless, I'd decided that I wanted to get into coding, but didn't have the time or the resources available. I am already thankful to Founders and Coders
          for
          offering a friendly, inviting place to learn how to code. I've met some really lovely, helpful, and interesting people during the meetups,
          and
          have had nothing but positive experiences thus far. <br><br>Additionally, as someone who values altruism, and as someone that currently works in the charity sector themselves, the ethos of helping others once you have honed
          your craft massively appeals to me. Similarly, having a background in teaching further makes me excited about the prospect of mentoring fellow learners once I have the know-how to do so.</p>
